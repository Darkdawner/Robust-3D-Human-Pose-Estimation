# robust-3D-human-pose-estimation
## Introduction
This is the a demo of the paper [Robust Estimation of 3D Human Poses from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2282) by Python. 
## Dataset
**CMU dataset** can be downloaded [here](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/).
## Start
1.Cvxpy

Cvxpy can be installed by `pip3 install cvxpy`.


2.SPAMS

SPAMS (SPArse Modeling Software) is an optimization toolbox for solving various sparse estimation problems.
* Dictionary learning and matrix factorization (NMF, sparse PCA, ...)
* Solving sparse decomposition problems with LARS, coordinate descent, OMP, SOMP, proximal methods
* Solving structured sparse decomposition problems (l1/l2, l1/linf, sparse group lasso, tree-structured regularization, structured sparsity with overlapping groups,...).
